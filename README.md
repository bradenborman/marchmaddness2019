## How to play
This game takes place in March every year and ranges through the College basketball Turnament. 

It is a simple Market concept. When you sign up, you are givin some cash in my currency. You are free to use that money to visit the market and buy shares teams.  You are free to spend it however you see fit. You may want to invest all of it one one team, you may even split it among a unique combination. Another option may be to play agressive and buy before each game is played and then sell once the prices are modifed. 

Making money is simple; if you own shares and the team wins in real life, the price will go up, resulting in your portfolio increasing value as well. If you hold a team that loses, they may lose values too. 

There will be 67 games played and 67 chances to make money. 

The way the new price is determined, I look at the vegas odds and then do some math with the winning margin. If the winning team was favored by 5 and won by 9. I split the difference, then add mulitpled by 100. Same to the lossing team, just subtracting instead. 

###Examples:

Duke VS Saint Mary's

Duke current cost per share  = $7,500
Saint Mary's current cost per share  = $2,200

**Example One:**

| DUKE        | Saint Mary's       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Favored by 6 and won by 15       | Duke favored by 6 and lost by 15   |
| (15-6=9) => 9 * 100 = 900        | (15-6=9) => 9 * 100 = 900      |
| $7,500 + 900 = $8,400            | $2,200 - 900 = $8,400      |  
| **Duke up 12%**                 | **Saint Mary's down 40.9%**     |
